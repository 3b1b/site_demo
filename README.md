# Introduction

This is a demo site for Bloggification of all 3Blue1Brown content.
Eventually, all videos will be incorporated into this project, but for now we have a single post available for [Fourier transforms](contents/fourier_transforms/fourier_transforms.md).

Please let us know how you feel about this type of content!

We will hopefully be allowing community contributions in the near future, but are still deciding the best way to do this.

**Notes and features:**
1. There should be a "Print" and "Blog" mode for each post, where the blog mode is composed of several clips from 3blue1brown conten, but print mode is meant to be printed and read offline (potentially).
2. All images are licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode). This means that all the content can be used in any project for non-commercial purposes as long as there is attribution to Grant Sanderson and there are no changes to the license of derivative work.
