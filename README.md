# Introduction

This is a demo site for Bloggification of all 3Blue1Brown content.
Eventually, all videos will be incorporated into this project, but for now we have a single post available for [Fourier transforms](contents/fourier_transforms/fourier_transforms.md).

Please let us know how you feel about this type of content!

We will hopefully be allowing community contributions in the near future, but are still deciding the best way to do this.

**Notes and features:**
1. There should be a "Print" and "Blog" mode for each post, where the blog mode is composed of several clips from 3Blue1Brown content, but print mode is meant to be printed and read offline (potentially). To switch between these modes, click on the "PRINT" or "BLOG" button at the top left of the toolbar.
2. All images are licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode). This means that all the content can be used in any project for non-commercial purposes as long as there is attribution to Grant Sanderson and there are no changes to the license of derivative work.
3. Next to the Blog / Print switch button, there is an "A" you can use to change the theme to dark or sepia if you wish.
4. This is a work in progress and is still missing a few features.

**Desired Feedback**

There are a few specific questions we would like to ask about this content:
1. Is the print mode useful for your workflow? Could you see this style of content being useful in a classroom or as a leisurely read over the weekend?
2. What about a physically printed version of several 3Blue1Brown series?
3. Would you be willing to help make similar content?
4. What other features would you want in a project like this?
