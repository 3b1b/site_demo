# 1-1+1-1+...

When one takes one from one  
plus one from one plus one 
and on and on but ends  
anon then starts again, 
then some sums sum to one, 
to zero other ones. 
One wonders who'd have won 
had stopping not been done; 
had he summed every bit 
until the infinite. 

Lest you should think that such 
less well-known sums are much 
ado about nonsense 
I do give these two cents: 
The universe has got 
an answer which is not 
what most would first surmise, 
it is a compromise, 
and though it seems a laugh 
 the universe gives “half”.
