# Abstraction

The crux of thought,   
computer science,   
language, and how math arose,  
abstraction brought  
a key alliance  
syncing facts who seem opposed.  

The first is how   
our minds are tuned to   
focus on at most one thought.  
Though well endowed,   
they’re not immune to   
puzzlement when overwrought.  

But secondly  
the facts of nature   
interweave dependently,  
so how do we   
conceive this nature  
in its multiplicity?  

We first extract   
a common trait  
of things too complex to be known,  
then to “abstract”,   
reformulate   
this trait as something in its own.  

As such it’s pulled  
from all distractions,  
single, hence conceivable.    
But when minds hold  
this dense abstraction,  
They enclose a system whole.   

For “things” and their “traits”,   
though separately named,  
do more than relate:  
They’re one and the same.
