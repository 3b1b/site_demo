# Moser's Circle Problem

Take two points on a circle,  
and draw a line straight through.  
The space that was encircled  
is divided into two.  

To these points add a third one,  
which gives us two more chords.  
The space through which these lines run  
has been fissured into four.  

Continue with a fourth point,  
and three more lines drawn straight.  
The new number of disjoint  
regions sums, in all, to eight.  

A fifth point and its four lines  
support this pattern gleaned.  
Counting sections, one divines  
that there are now sixteen.  

This pattern here of doubling  
does seems a sturdy one.  
But one more step is troubling  
as the sixth gives thirty-one.
