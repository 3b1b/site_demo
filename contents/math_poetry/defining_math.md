# Defining Math

In math, we strive and stickle with a pride,  
to wash away all ambiguity.  
And yet, definers cannot all decide  
what “math” itself means.  What an irony!  
Perhaps a science, solving mysteries,  
but happy to pursue what seems absurd.  
Perhaps a brother of philosophies,  
but with a rigid rigour in each word.  
Computer science might be suitable,  
but most of math is not computable.  

Perhaps it is a language of its own,  
which, as to english, has the most false friends.  
Perhaps religion, where the truth alone  
is worshiped, giving means as well as ends.  
Perhaps a sister of creative arts,  
but one arousing reason, not a sense.  
Indeed it shares a number of its parts  
with almost every study in some sense.  
But it’s an orphan, floating in abstract,  
and it alone encloses what’s exact
