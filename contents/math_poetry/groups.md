# Groups

“What is a group?”  
$$\qquad$$ “A symmetry of things.”

“Of things from where?”  
$$\qquad$$ “Oh, those from any place.”

“But where in math?”  
$$\qquad$$ “In math?  A vector space.”

“And what is that?”  
$$\qquad$$ “It’s what a field brings.”

“And what are fields?”  
$$\qquad$$ “They’re Symmetries of groups.”

“A group’s own group?”  
$$\qquad$$ “Why yes, when both are one.”

“So now we’re back?”  
$$\qquad$$ “Indeed, where we’d begun.”

“So where to start?”  
$$\qquad$$ “Where you start any loop.”

“And where is that?”  
$$\qquad$$ “From anywhere within.”

“And if you're out?”  
$$\qquad$$ “Then why would you begin?”
