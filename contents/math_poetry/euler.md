## Poem
Famously  
start with e,  
raise to π  
with an i.  
we've been taught  
by a lot  
that you've got  
minus one.  


Can we glean  
what it means?  
For such words  
are absurd.  
How to treat  
the repeat  
of a feat  
πi times?  

This is bound  
to confound  
'til your mind  
redefines  
these amounts  
one can't count  
which surmount  
our friend e.  

Numbers act  
as abstract  
functions which  
slide the rich  
2d space  
in its place  
with a grace  
when they sum.  

Multiplied,  
they don’t slide,  
acting a   
second way.  
They rotate,  
and dilate,  
but keep straight  
that same plane.  
 

Now what we  
write as e  
to the x  
won’t perplex  
when you know  
it’s for show  
that “x" goes  
up and right.  
 

It does not,  
as you thought,  
repeat e  
product e.  
It functions  
with gumption  
on functions  
of the plane.  
 

It turns slides  
side to side  
into growths  
and shrinks both.  
Up and downs  
come around  
as turns round,  
which is key!  
 

This is why  
π times i,  
which slides north  
is brought forth  
and returned,  
we have learned,  
as a turn  
halfway round.  
 

Minus one,  
matched by none,  
turns this way,  
hence we’re done.
