# How to Contribute

This blog series is lead by Grant Sanderson, but curated entirely by the community.
If there is an error in any of the blog posts or you feel the post does not capture the essense of a video topic, please feel free to create an issue on github and we will be more than willing to discuss it.

To start, the blog has been populated with a series of stub articles, each containing the video that will eventually be transformed into text.
If you would like to help in this process, we have created a master overview for all of the videos that still need bloggification and the steps left before the content is complete and ready to be put up on the site.
