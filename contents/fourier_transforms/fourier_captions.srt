00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,280
This right here is what we're going to build to, this video:

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,600
A certain animated approach to thinking about a super-important idea from math:

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,960
The Fourier transform.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,640
For anyone unfamiliar with what that is,

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,180
my #1 goal here is just for the video to be an introduction to that topic.

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,860
But even for those of you who are already familiar with it,

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,500
I still think that there's something fun

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,800
and enriching about seeing what all of its components actually look like.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,320
The central example, to start, is gonna be the classic one:

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,360
Decomposing frequencies from sound.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,720
But after that, I also really wanna show a glimpse of how this idea extends well beyond sound and frequency,

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,420
and to many seemingly disparate areas of math, and even physics.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,120
Really, it is crazy just how ubiquitous this idea is.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,940
Let's dive in.

15
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,700
This sound right here is a pure A.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,980
440 beats per second.

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,500
Meaning, if you were to measure the air pressure

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,160
right next to your headphones, or your speaker, as a function of time, it would oscillate up and down

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,100
around its usual equilibrium, in this wave.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,500
making 440 oscillations each second.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,020
A lower-pitched note, like a D, has the same structure, just fewer beats per second.

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,020
And when both of them are played at once, what do you think the resulting pressure vs. time graph looks like?

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,180
Well, at any point in time, this pressure difference

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,280
is gonna be the sum of what it would be for each of those notes individually.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
Which, let's face it, is kind of a complicated thing to think about.

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,320
At some points, the peaks match up with each other,

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,420
resulting in a really high pressure.

28
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,740
At other points, they tend to cancel out.

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,380
And all in all, what you get is a wave-ish pressure vs. time graph,

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,000
that is not a pure sine wave; it's something more complicated.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,520
And as you add in other notes, the wave gets more and more complicated.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,080
But right now, all it is is a combination of four pure frequencies.

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,400
So it seems...needlessly complicated, given the low amount of information put into it.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,980
A microphone recording any sound

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,160
just picks up on the air pressure at many different points in time.

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,480
It only "sees" the final sum.

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,400
So our central question is gonna be how you can take

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,780
a signal like this,

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,880
and decompose it

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,000
into the pure frequencies that make it up.

41
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,000
Pretty interesting, right?

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,920
Adding up those signals really mixes them all together.

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,160
So pulling them back apart...feels

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,400
akin to unmixing multiple paint colors that have all been stirred up together.

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,400
The general strategy is gonna be to build for ourselves a mathematical machine

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,740
that treats signals with a given frequency...

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,720
..differently from how it treats other signals.

48
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,120
To start,

49
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,640
consider simply taking a pure signal

50
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,380
say, with a lowly three beats per second, so that we can plot it easily.

51
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,060
And let's limit ourselves to looking at a finite portion of this graph.

52
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,220
In this case, the portion between zero seconds, and 4.5 seconds.

53
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,720
The key idea,

54
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,440
is gonna be to take this graph, and sort of wrap it up around a circle.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,660
Concretely, here's what I mean by that.

56
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,420
Imagine a little rotating vector where each point in time

57
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,500
its length is equal to the height of our graph for that time.

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,540
So, high points of the graph correspond to a greater disance from the origin,

59
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,080
and low points end up closer to the origin.

60
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,120
And right now, I'm drawing it in such a way that moving forward two seconds in time

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,080
corresponds to a single rotation around the circle.

62
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,880
Our little vector drawing this wound up graph

63
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,520
is rotating at half a cycle per second.

64
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,640
So, this is important.
There are two different frequencies at play here:

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,620
There's the frequency of our signal, which goes up and down, three times per second.

66
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,140
And then, separately, there's the frequency with which we're wrapping the graph around the circle.

67
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,220
Which, at the moment, is half of a rotation per second.

68
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,520
But we can adjust that second frequency however we want.

69
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,920
Maybe we want to wrap it around faster...

70
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,300
..or maybe we go and wrap it around slower.

71
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,500
And that choice of winding frequency determines what the wound up graph looks like.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,400
Some of the diagrams that come out of this can be pretty complicated; although, they are very pretty.

73
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,080
But it's important to keep in mind that all that's happening here

74
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,860
is that we're wrapping the signal around a circle.

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,540
The vertical lines that I'm drawing up top, by the way,

76
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,840
are just a way to keep track of the distance on the original graph

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,860
that corresponds to a full rotation around the circle.

78
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,280
So, lines spaced out by 1.5 seconds

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,480
would mean it takes 1.5 seconds to make one full revolution.

80
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,620
And at this point, we might have some sort of vague sense that something special will happen

81
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,360
when the winding frequency matches the frequency of our signal: three beats per second.

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,700
All the high points on the graph happen on the right side of the circle

83
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,980
And all of the low points happen on the left.

84
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:58,060
But how precisely can we take advantage of that in our attempt to build a frequency-unmixing machine?

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,140
Well, imagine this graph is having some kind of mass to it, like a metal wire.

86
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,640
This little dot is going to represent the center of mass of that wire.

87
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,560
As we change the frequency, and the graph winds up differently,

88
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,220
that center of mass kind of wobbles around a bit.

89
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,000
And for most of the winding frequencies,

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,340
the peaks and valleys are all spaced out around the circle in such a way that

91
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,020
the center of mass stays pretty close to the origin.

92
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,480
But!

93
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,080
When the winding frequency is the same as the frequency of our signal,

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,380
in this case, three cycles per second,

95
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,740
all of the peaks are on the right,

96
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,380
and all of the valleys are on the left..

97
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,880
..so the center of mass is unusually far to the right.

98
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,000
Here, to capture this, let's draw some kind of plot

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,740
that keeps track of where that center of mass is for each winding frequency.

100
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,700
Of course, the center of mass is a two-dimensional thing, and requires two coordinates to fully keep track of,

101
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,100
but for the moment, let's only keep track of the x coordinate.

102
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,000
So, for a frequency of 0, when everything is bunched up on the right,

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,240
this x coordinate is relatively high.

104
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,360
And then, as you increase that winding frequency,

105
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,900
and the graph balances out around the circle,

106
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,940
the x coordinate of that center of mass goes closer to 0,

107
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,900
and it just kind of wobbles around a bit.

108
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,700
But then, at three beats per second, there's a spike as everything lines up to the right.

109
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,320
This right here is the central construct,

110
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,100
so let's sum up what we have so far:

111
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,020
We have that original intensity vs. time graph,

112
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,160
and then we have the wound up version of that in some two-dimensional plane,

113
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,900
and then, as a third thing, we have a plot

114
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,600
for how the winding frequency influences the center of mass of that graph.

115
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,200
And by the way, let's look back at those really low frequencies near 0.

116
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,000
This big spike around 0 in our new frequency plot

117
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,720
just corresponds to the fact that the whole cosine wave is shifted up.

118
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,580
If I had chosen a signal oscillates around 0,

119
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,520
dipping into negative values,

120
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,200
then, as we play around with various winding frequences,

121
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,340
this plot of the winding frequencies vs. center of mass

122
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,740
would only have a spike at the value of three.

123
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,680
But, negative values are a little bit weird and messy to think about

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,400
especially for a first example,

125
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,800
so let's just continue thinking in terms of the shifted-up graph.

126
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,680
I just want you to understand that that spike around 0 only corresponds to the shift.

127
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,580
Our main focus, as far as frequency decomposition is concerned, is that bump at three.

128
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,880
This whole plot is what I'll call

129
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,300
the "Almost Fourier Transform" of the original signal.

130
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,280
There's a couple small distinctions between this and the actual Fourier transform,

131
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,200
which I'll get to in a couple minutes,

132
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,960
but already, you might be able to see how this machine lets us pick out the frequency of a signal.

133
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,800
Just to play around with it a little bit more,

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,500
take a different pure signal, let's say with a lower frequency of two beats per second,

135
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,740
and do the same thing.

136
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,780
Wind it around a circle,

137
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,600
imagine different potential winding frequencies,

138
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,580
and as you do that keep track of where the center of mass of that graph is,

139
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,100
and then plot the x coordinate of that center of mass

140
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,200
as you adjust the winding frequency.

141
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,640
Just like before, we get a spike

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,960
when the winding frequency is the same as the signal frequency,

143
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,880
which in this case, is when it equals two cycles per second.

144
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,720
But the real key point, the thing that makes this machine so delightful,

145
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,940
is how it enables us to take a signal consisting of multiple frequencies,

146
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,580
and pick out what they are.

147
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,100
Imagine taking the two signals we just looked at:

148
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,240
The wave with three beats per second, and the wave with two beats per second,

149
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,900
and add them up.

150
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,300
Like I said earlier, what you get is no longer a nice, pure cosine wave;

151
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,100
it's something a little more complicated.

152
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,480
But imagine throwing this into our winding-frequency machine...

153
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,460
..it is certainly the case that as you wrap this thing around, it looks a lot more complicated;

154
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:10,960
you have this

155
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,500
chaos (1) and

156
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,240
chaos (2) and chaos (3) and

157
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,860
chaos (4) and then

158
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,360
WOOP!

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,400
Things seem to line up really nicely at two cycles per second,

160
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,500
and as you continue on it's more chaos (5)

161
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,140
and more chaos (6)

162
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,640
more chaos (7)

163
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,340
chaos (8), chaos (9), chaos (10),

164
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,840
WOOP!

165
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,280
Things nicely align again at three cycles per second.

166
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,300
And, like I said before, the wound up graph can look kind of busy and complicated,

167
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,520
but all it is is the relatively simple idea of wrapping the graph around a circle.

168
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,380
It's just a more complicated graph, and a pretty quick winding frequency.

169
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,300
Now what's going on here with the two different spikes,

170
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,780
is that if you were to take two signals,

171
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,060
and then apply this Almost-Fourier transform to each of them individually,

172
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,140
and then add up the results,

173
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,900
what you get is the same as if you first

174
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,440
added up the signals, and then applied this Almost-Fourier transorm.

175
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,820
And the attentive viewers among you might wanna pause and ponder, and...

176
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,440
..convince yourself that what I just said is actually true.

177
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,340
It's a pretty good test to verify for yourself that it's clear what exactly is being measured

178
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,120
inside this winding machine.

179
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,280
Now this property makes things really useful to us,

180
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,900
because the transform of a pure frequency

181
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,660
is close to 0 everywhere

182
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,060
except for a spike around that frequency.

183
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,960
So when you add together two pure frequencies,

184
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,920
the transform graph just has these little peaks above the frequencies that went into it.

185
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,620
So this little mathematical machine does exactly what we wanted.

186
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,140
It pulls out the original frequencies from their jumbled up sums,

187
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,780
unmixing the mixed bucket of paint.

188
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,080
And before continuing into the full math that describes this operation,

189
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,380
let's just get a quick glimpse of one context where this thing is useful:

190
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,440
Sound editing.

191
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Let's say that you have some recording, and it's got an annoying high pitch that you'd like to filter out.

192
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,360
Well, at first, your signal is coming in as a function of various intensities over time.

193
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,160
Different voltages given to your speaker from one millisecond to the next.

194
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,960
But we want to think of this in terms of frequencies,

195
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,100
so,

196
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,060
when you take the Fourier transform of that signal,

197
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,620
the annoying high pitch is going to show up just as a spike at some high frequency.

198
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,480
Filtering that out, by just smushing the spike down,

199
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,660
what you'd be looking at is the Fourier transform of a sound that's just like your recording,

200
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,620
only without that high frequency.

201
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,200
Luckily, there's a notion of an inverse Fourier transform

202
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,660
that tells you which signal would have produced this as its Fourier transform.

203
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,240
I'll be talking about inverse much more fully in the next video,

204
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,000
but long story short, applying the Fourier transform

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,940
to the Fourier transform gives you back something close to the original function.

206
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,920
Mm, kind of... this is...

207
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,620
..a little bit of a lie, but it's in the direction of the truth.

208
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,420
And most of the reason that it's a lie is that I still have yet to tell you what the actual Fourier Transform is,

209
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,620
since it's a little more complex than this x-coordinate-of-the-center-of-mass idea.

210
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,140
First off, bringing back this wound up graph, and looking at its center of mass,

211
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,440
the x coordinate is really only half the story, right?

212
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,520
I mean, this thing is in two dimensions, it's got a y coordinate as well.

213
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,860
And, as is typical in math, whenever you're dealing with something two-dimensional,

214
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,860
it's elegant to think of it as the complex plane,

215
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,520
where this center of mass is gonna be a complex number,

216
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,160
that has both a real and an imaginary part.

217
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,480
And the reason for talking in terms of complex numbers, rather than just saying,

218
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,820
"It has two coordinates,"

219
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,600
is that complex numbers lend themselves to really nice descriptions of things that have to do with winding,

220
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,820
and rotation.

221
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,020
For example:

222
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,340
Euler's formula famously tells us that if you take e to some number times i,

223
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,300
you're gonna land on the point that you get

224
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:47,120
if you were to walk that number of units around a circle with radius 1, counter-clockwise starting on the right.

225
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,520
So,

226
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,340
imagine you wanted to describe rotating at a rate of one cycle per second.

227
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,160
One thing that you could do

228
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,380
is take the expression "e^2π*i*t,"

229
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,740
where t is the amount of time that has passed.

230
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,820
Since, for a circle with radius 1,

231
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,080
2π describes the full length of its circumference.

232
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,140
And... this is a little bit dizzying to look at, so maybe you wanna describe a different frequency...

233
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,040
..something lower and more reasonable...

234
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,920
..and for that, you would just multiply that time t in the exponent

235
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,720
by the frequency, f.

236
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:27,280
For example, if f was one tenth, then this vector makes one full turn every ten seconds,

237
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,520
since the time t has to increase all the way to ten before the full exponent looks like 2πi.

238
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:40,220
I have another video giving some intuition on why this is the behavior of e^x for imaginary inputs,

239
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
if you're curious 😉,

240
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,820
but for right now, we're just gonna take it as a given.

241
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,300
Now why am I telling you this you this, you might ask.

242
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:53,280
Well, it gives us a really nice way to write down the idea of winding up the graph into a single, tight little formula.

243
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,360
First off, the convention in the context of Fourier transforms

244
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,060
is to think about rotating in the clockwise direction,

245
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,680
so let's go ahead and throw a negative sign up into that exponent.

246
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,460
Now, take some function describing a signal intensity vs. time, like this pure cosine wave we had before,

247
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,000
and call it g(t).

248
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,200
If you multiply this exponential expression times g(t),

249
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,340
it means that the rotating complex number is getting scaled up and down

250
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,840
according to the value of this function.

251
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,880
So you can think of this little rotating vector with its changing length

252
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,420
as drawing the wound up graph.

253
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,660
So think about it, this is awesome.

254
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,580
This really small expression

255
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,320
is a super-elegant way to encapsulate

256
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,660
the whole idea of winding a graph around a circle with a variable frequency f.

257
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,440
And remember, that thing we want to do with this wound up graph

258
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,380
is to track its center of mass.

259
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,200
So think about what formula is going to capture that.

260
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,940
Well, to approximate it at least,

261
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,580
you might sample a whole bunch of times from the original signal,

262
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,560
see where those points end up on the wound up graph,

263
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
and then just take an average.

264
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,300
That is, add them all together, as complex numbers,

265
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,580
and then divide by the number of points that you've sampled.

266
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,260
This will become more accurate if you sample more points which are closer together.

267
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,080
And in the limit,

268
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,400
rather than looking at the sum of a whole bunch of points divided by the number of points,

269
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,620
you take an integral of this function, divided by the size of the time interval that we're looking at.

270
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,520
Now the idea of integrating a complex-valued function might seem weird,

271
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,900
and to anyone who's shaky with calculus, maybe even intimidating,

272
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,700
but the underlying meaning here really doesn't require any calculus knowledge.

273
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,740
The whole expression is just the center of mass of the wound up graph.

274
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,060
So...

275
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,600
Great!

276
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,840
Step-by-step, we have built up this

277
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,800
kind of complicated, but, let's face it, surprisingly small expression

278
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,820
for the whole winding machine idea that I talked about.

279
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,920
And now, there is only one final distinction to point out

280
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,740
between this and the actual, honest-to-goodness Fourier transform.

281
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,300
Namely, just don't divide out by the time interval.

282
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,520
The Fourier transform is just the integral part of this.

283
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,880
What that means is that instead of looking at the center of mass,

284
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,220
you would scale it up by some amount.

285
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,260
If the portion of the original graph you were using spanned three seconds,

286
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,600
you would multiply the center of mass by three.

287
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,320
If it was spanning six seconds,

288
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,760
you would multiply the center of mass by six.

289
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,640
Physically, this has the effect that when a certain frequency persists for a long time,

290
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,420
then the magnitude of the Fourier transform at that frequency is scaled up more and more.

291
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,200
For example, what we're looking at right here

292
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,900
is how when you have a pure frequency of two beats per second,

293
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,900
and you wind it around the graph at two cycles per second,

294
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,360
the center of mass stays in the same spot, right? It's just tracing out the same shape.

295
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,140
But the longer that signal persists, the larger the value of the Fourier transform, at that frequency.

296
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,600
For other frequencies, though, even if you just increase it by a bit,

297
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,000
this is cancelled out by the fact that for longer time intervals

298
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,500
you're giving the wound up graph more of a chance to balance itself around the circle.

299
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,360
That is...a lot of different moving parts, so let's step back and summarize what we have so far.

300
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,560
The Fourier transform of an intensity vs. time function, like g(t),

301
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
is a new function,

302
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,920
which doesn't have time as an input,

303
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,900
but instead takes in a frequency,

304
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,800
what I've been calling "the winding frequency."

305
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,420
In terms of notation, by the way, the common convention is to call this new function

306
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,360
"g-hat," with a little circumflex on top of it.

307
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,860
Now the output of this function is a complex number,

308
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,300
some point in the 2D plane,

309
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,160
that corresponds to the strength of a given frequency in the original signal.

310
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,240
The plot that I've been graphing for the Fourier transform,

311
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,340
is just the real component of that output, the x-coordinate

312
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,700
But you could also graph the imaginary component separately, if you wanted a fuller description.

313
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,460
And all of this is being encapsulated inside that formula that we built up.

314
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,520
And out of context, you can imagine how seeing this formula would seem sort of daunting.

315
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,260
But if you understand how exponentials correspond to rotation...

316
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,880
..how multiplying that by the function g(t)

317
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,780
means drawing a wound up version of the graph,

318
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,700
and how an integral of a complex-valued function

319
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,960
can be interpreted in terms of a center-of-mass idea,

320
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,520
you can see how this whole thing carries with it a very rich, intuitive meaning.

321
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,720
And, by the way, one quick small note before we can call this wrapped up.

322
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,540
Even though in practice, with things like sound editing,

323
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,100
you'll be integrating over a finite time interval,

324
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,520
the theory of Fourier transforms is often phrased where the bounds of this integral are -∞ and ∞.

325
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,660
Concretely, what that means is that you consider this expression for all possible finite time intervals,

326
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,980
and you just ask,

327
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,420
"What is its limit as that time interval grows to ∞?"

328
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,900
And...man, oh man,

329
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,060
there is so much more to say!

330
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,780
So much, I don't wanna call it done here.

331
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,700
This transform extends to corners of math well beyond the idea of extracting frequencies from signal.

332
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,280
So, the next video I put out is gonna go through a couple of these,

333
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,320
and that's really where things start getting interesting.

334
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,080
So, stay subscribed for when that comes out,

335
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,880
or an alternate option is to just binge a couple 3blue1brown videos

336
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,580
so that the YouTube recommender is more inclined to show you new things that come out...

337
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,900
..really, the choice is yours!

338
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,320
And to close things off, I have something pretty fun: A mathematical puzzler from this video's sponsor,

339
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,180
Jane Street,

340
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,540
who's looking to recruit more technical talent.

341
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,760
So, let's say that you have a closed, bounded convex set C sitting in 3D space,

342
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,460
and then let B be the boundary of that space,

343
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,640
the surface of your complex blob.

344
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,140
Now imagine taking every possible pair of points on that surface,

345
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,360
and adding them up, doing a vector sum.

346
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,700
Let's name this set of all possible sums D.

347
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,100
Your task is to prove that D is also a convex set.

348
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,680
So, Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm,

349
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,080
and if you're the kind of person who enjoys math and solving puzzles like this,

350
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,060
the team there really values intellectual curiosity.

351
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,020
So, they might be interested in hiring you.

352
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,840
And they're looking both for full-time employees and interns.

353
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,200
For my part, I can say that some people I've interacted with there just seem to

354
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
love math, and sharing math, and

355
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,880
when they're hiring they look less at a background in finance

356
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,740
than they do at how you think, how you learn, and how you solve problems,

357
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,400
hence the sponsorship of a 3blue1brown video.

358
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,660
If you want the answer to that puzzler, or to learn more about what they do, or to apply for open positions,

00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,600
